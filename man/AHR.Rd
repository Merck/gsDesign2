\title{Average hazard ratio under non-proportional hazards (test version)}
\usage{
AHR(
  enrollRates = tibble::tibble(Stratum = "All", duration = c(2, 2, 10), rate = c(3, 6,
    9)),
  failRates = tibble::tibble(Stratum = "All", duration = c(3, 100), failRate =
    log(2)/c(9, 18), hr = c(0.9, 0.6), dropoutRate = rep(0.001, 2)),
  totalDuration = 30,
  ratio = 1,
  simple = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{enrollRates}{Piecewise constant enrollment rates by stratum and time period.}

\item{failRates}{Piecewise constant control group failure rates, duration for each piecewise constant period,
hazard ratio for experimental vs control, and dropout rates by stratum and time period.}

\item{totalDuration}{Total follow-up from start of enrollment to data cutoff;
this can be a single value or a vector of positive numbers.}

\item{ratio}{ratio of experimental to control randomization.}

\item{simple}{logical; if TRUE (default), for each value in input totalDuration overall event count,
statistical information and average hazard ratio are given;
if FALSE, hazard ratio, expected events and statistical information are produced by stratum and underlying hazard ratio.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with \code{Time} (from \code{totalDuration}), \code{AHR} (average hazard ratio),
\code{Events} (expected number of events), info (information under given scenarios),
and info0 (information under related null hypothesis) for each value of \code{totalDuration} input;
if \code{simple=FALSE}, \code{Stratum} and \code{t} (beginning of each constant HR period) are also returned
and \code{HR} is returned instead of \code{AHR}
}
\description{
\code{AHR()} provides a geometric average hazard ratio under
various non-proportional hazards assumptions for either single or multiple strata studies.
The piecewise exponential distribution allows a simple method to specify a distribution
and enrollment pattern where the enrollment, failure and dropout rates changes over time.

         \item Recompute events, hazard ratio and information under the given scenario of the combined data for each strata.

       \item Combine the results for all time points by summarizing the results by adding up the number of events,
      information under the null and the given scenarios.
      }
   \item Return a tibble of overall event count, statistical information and average hazard ratio
   of each value in totalDuration if the input simple is true, or a tibble of hazard ratio,
   expected events and statistical information  produced by stratum and
   underlying hazard ratio if the input simple is false.
   \item Calculation of \code{AHR} for different design scenarios, and the comparison to the
   simulation studies are defined in vignette/AHRVignette.Rmd.
