\arguments{
\item{enroll_rate}{Enrollment rates defined by \code{define_enroll_rate()}.}

\item{fail_rate}{Failure and dropout rates defined by \code{define_fail_rate()}.}

\item{alpha}{One-sided Type I error.}

\item{beta}{Type II error.}

\item{info_frac}{Targeted information fraction at each analysis. See details for properly set it up.}

\item{analysis_time}{Targeted time of analysis. See details for properly set it up.}

\item{ratio}{Experimental:Control randomization ratio.}

\item{binding}{Indicator of whether futility bound is binding;
default of \code{FALSE} is recommended.}

\item{upper}{Function to compute upper bound.
\itemize{
\item \code{gs_spending_bound()}: alpha-spending efficacy bounds.
\item \code{gs_b()}: fixed efficacy bounds.
}}

\item{upar}{Parameters passed to \code{upper}.
\itemize{
\item If \code{upper = gs_b}, then \code{upar} is a numerical vector specifying the fixed efficacy bounds per analysis.
\item If \code{upper = gs_spending_bound}, then \code{upar} is a list including
\itemize{
\item \code{sf} for the spending function family.
\item \code{total_spend} for total alpha spend.
\item \code{param} for the parameter of the spending function.
\item \code{timing} (not required for information-based spending) for the spending time if different from information-based spending.
}
}}

\item{lower}{Function to compute lower bound, which can be set up similarly as \code{upper}. More details can be find in \href{https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-seven-test-types.html}{this vignette}.}

\item{lpar}{Parameters passed to \code{lower}, which can be set up similarly as \code{upar.}}

\item{h1_spending}{Indicator that lower bound to be set by spending
under alternate hypothesis (input \code{fail_rate})
if spending is used for lower bound.}

\item{test_upper}{Indicator of which analyses should include an upper
(efficacy) bound; single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates all analyses;
otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate
which analyses will have an efficacy bound.}

\item{test_lower}{Indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound;
single value of \code{TRUE} (default) indicates all analyses;
single value \code{FALSE} indicated no lower bound; otherwise, a logical vector
of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have a
lower bound.}

\item{info_scale}{Information scale for calculation. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"h0_h1_info"} (default): variance under both null and alternative hypotheses is used.
\item \code{"h0_info"}: variance under null hypothesis is used.
\item \code{"h1_info"}: variance under alternative hypothesis is used.
}}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.
Larger values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
Normally, \code{r} will not be changed by the user.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter for boundary convergence (on Z-scale).}

\item{interval}{An interval that is presumed to include the time at which
expected event count is equal to targeted event.}
}
\value{
A list with input parameters, enrollment rate, analysis, and bound.
\itemize{
\item The \verb{$input} is a list including \code{alpha}, \code{beta}, \code{ratio}, etc.
\item The \verb{$enroll_rate} is a table showing the enrollment for arriving the targeted power (\code{1 - beta}).
\item The \verb{$fail_rate} is a table showing the failure and dropout rates, which is the same as input.
\item The \verb{$bound} is a table summarizing the efficacy and futility bound per analysis.
\item The \code{analysis} is a table summarizing the analysis time, sample size, events, average HR, treatment effect and statistical information per analysis.

\description{
Calculate sample size and bounds given the power in group sequential design using average hazard ratio under non-proportional hazards
}
\details{
The parameters \code{info_frac} and \code{analysis_time} are used to determine the timing for interim and final analyses.
\itemize{
\item If the interim analysis is decided by targeted information fraction and the study duration is known,
then \code{info_frac} is a numerical vector where each element (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1)
represents the information fraction for each analysis.
The \code{analysis_time}, which defaults to 36, indicates the time for the final analysis.
\item If the interim analysis is determined solely by the targeted analysis timing,
then \code{analysis_time} will be a vector specifying the time for each analysis.
\item If both the targeted analysis time and the targeted information fraction are utilized, which arrives latter,
then both \code{info_frac} and \code{analysis_time} should be provided as vectors.
