\arguments{
\item{enroll_rate}{enrollment rates}

\item{fail_rate}{failure and dropout rates}

\item{events}{Targeted events at each analysis}

\item{analysis_time}{Minimum time of analysis}

\item{upper}{Function to compute upper bound}

\item{upar}{Parameter passed to \code{upper()}}

\item{lower}{Function to compute lower bound}

\item{lpar}{Parameter passed to \code{lower()}}

\item{test_lower}{indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
single value FALSE indicated no lower bound; otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have a
lower bound}

\item{test_upper}{indicator of which analyses should include an upper (efficacy) bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound}

\item{ratio}{Experimental:Control randomization ratio (not yet implemented)}

\item{binding}{indicator of whether futility bound is binding; default of FALSE is recommended}

\item{info_scale}{the information scale for calculation}

\item{r}{Integer, at least 2; default of 18 recommended by Jennison and Turnbull}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter for boundary convergence (on Z-scale)}
}
\value{
a \code{tibble} with columns \code{Analysis, Bound, Z, Probability, theta, Time, AHR, Events}.
Contains a row for each analysis and each bound.
}
\description{
Group sequential design power using average hazard ratio under non-proportional hazards
}
\details{
Bound satisfy input upper bound specification in \code{upper, upar} and lower bound specification in \code{lower, lpar}.
The \code{AHR()} function computes statistical information at targeted event times.
The \code{tEvents()} function is used to get events and average HR at targeted \code{analysis_time}.
