\arguments{
\item{enroll_rate}{enrollment rates}

\item{fail_rate}{failure and dropout rates}

\item{event}{Targeted event at each analysis}

\item{analysis_time}{Minimum time of analysis}

\item{binding}{indicator of whether futility bound is binding; default of FALSE is recommended}

\item{upper}{Function to compute upper bound}

\item{lower}{Function to compute lower bound}

\item{upar}{Parameter passed to \code{upper()}}

\item{lpar}{Parameter passed to \code{lower()}}

\item{test_upper}{indicator of which analyses should include an upper (efficacy) bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound}

\item{test_lower}{indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
single value FALSE indicated no lower bound; otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have a
lower bound}

\item{weight}{weight of weighted log rank test
\itemize{
\item \code{"1"}= unweighted,
\item \code{"n"}= Gehan-Breslow,
\item \code{"sqrtN"}= Tarone-Ware,
\item \code{"FH_p[a]_q[b]"}= Fleming-Harrington with p=a and q=b
}}

\item{info_scale}{the information scale for calculation}

\item{approx}{approximate estimation method for Z statistics
\itemize{
\item \code{"event driven"} = only work under proportional hazard model with log rank test
\item \code{"asymptotic"}
}}

\item{r}{Integer, at least 2; default of 18 recommended by Jennison and Turnbull}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter for boundary convergence (on Z-scale)}
