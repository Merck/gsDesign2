\arguments{
\item{alpha}{One-sided Type I error (strictly between 0 and 1).}

\item{power}{Power (\code{NULL} to compute power or strictly between 0
and \code{1 - alpha} otherwise).}

\item{ratio}{Experimental:Control randomization ratio.}

\item{enroll_rate}{Enrollment rates.}

\item{fail_rate}{Failure and dropout rates.}

\item{study_duration}{Study duration.}

\item{tau}{Test parameter of milestone method.}
}
\value{
A table.
}
\description{
Computes fixed design sample size (given power) or power (given sample size)
for milestone method (Yung and Liu, 2020).
Returns a list with a basic summary.
