\value{
a \code{tibble} with columns \code{Analysis, Time, N, Events, AHR, delta, sigma2, theta, info, info0.}
\code{info, info0} contains statistical information under H1, H0, respectively.
For analysis \code{k}, \code{Time[k]} is the maximum of \code{analysis_time[k]} and the expected time
required to accrue the targeted \code{events[k]}.
\code{AHR} is expected average hazard ratio at each analysis.
}
\description{
Based on piecewise enrollment rate, failure rate, and dropout rates computes
approximate information and effect size using an average hazard ratio model.
}
\details{
The \code{AHR()} function computes statistical information at targeted event times.
The \code{tEvents()} function is used to get events and average HR at targeted \code{analysis_time}.
