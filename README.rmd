## Installation

You can install `gsDesign2` with:

```r
remotes::install_git(
  "https://stash.merck.com/scm/bards/gsdesign2.git",
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass(
    rstudioapi::showPrompt("ISID", message = "Enter your ISID"),
    rstudioapi::askForPassword()
  )
)
```


## Overview

The gsDesign2 package supports recent innovations group sequential clinical trial design including non-proportional hazards and graphical multiplicity control with group sequential design.
Computations are based on piecewise constant enrollment and piecewise exponential failure rates.
Stratified populations are supported. 
Power and sample size calculations based on using testing based on the logrank test.
