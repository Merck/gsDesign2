### Quick start

A quick start guide for gsDesign2.

- [Quick start for NPH sample size and
  power](https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/gsDesign2.md):

### NPH technical background

Some technical background introduction to non-proportional hazards, such
as Z-score, B-values, and canonical form.

  alternative
  hypothesis](https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-canonical-h0-h1.md):

  sequential
  design](https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-npe-integration.md):

### Comparision of multiple NPH tests

Comparison of power among different tests, such as regular logrank test,
weighted logrank test with different weights (i.e., Fleming-Harrington,
Magirr-Burman, etc.), and MaxCombo.

  scenarios](https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-compare-power-delay-effect.md):

### Designs with futility bounds

Designs with both efficacy and binding/unbinding futility bounds.

  hazards](https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/articles/story-nph-futility.md):
